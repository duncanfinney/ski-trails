Get Ski Trail Status

optional arguments:

  -o, --open            Open trails only
  -s SORT, --sort SORT  sort by (--sort difficulty)

By default, show all trails from config.yaml

## Config
The configuration file adds or removes resorts you want to get trail info for. Currently the vail plugin can support any vail resort (you could add Park City for example as they are owned by vail) and the abasin plugin adds Arapahoe Basin trails.

```
‚ûú cat config.yaml
resorts:
- name: Keystone
  urlBase: keystoneresort.com
  plugin: vail
- name: Vail
  urlBase: vail.com
